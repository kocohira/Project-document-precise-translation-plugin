# Project-document-precise-translation-plugin
###
The existing projects on starknet, ethereum, optitism and so on related to education have a relatively limited selection of languages. Although English is the world's common language, there are rarely more language versions available. I know that there are actually many loyal users of web3 in many countries around the world who suffer from their English proficiency and limit development (such as Vietnam, Brazil, Russia, etc.); For those who are not very proficient in English, if they use the browser's built-in translation module, it is often not suitable for the environment of code teaching, either due to inaccurate translation leading to deviation, or the comments in the code cannot be translated; Finally, language barriers can also bring about constant communication issues during the teaching process. So I plan to create a translation plugin that is embedded in browsers and compatible with various project documents and even web pages, using big data and AI technology, and increasing the accuracy of terminology for related teaching.
